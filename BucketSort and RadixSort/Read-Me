1. Implements Radix Sort to sort 10,000,000 values
2. Implements Bucket Sort to sort 10,000,000 values
3. Check if arrays are sorted
4. Bring in Quick Sort from previous lab to compare against Radix and Bucket
5. (Separately) Run program 3 times, documenting data in a spreadsheet
6. Uses recursive algorithm to display 10 largest from unsorted array
7. Calls Radix Sort on unsorted array, then function for 10 largest (results from 6 and 7 should match)
8. Repeat number 5 for 6 and 7
